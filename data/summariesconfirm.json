Experts explain.": "Three people have died in Australia and another person is sick after accidentally eating what appears to be death cap mushrooms at a family meal. The meal was prepared by Erin Patterson and served to her former parents-in-law, as well as her mother-in-law's sister and husband at her home, CNN reports. Gail Patterson, 70, and her sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, died in the hospital within days of eating the meal; Gail's 70-year-old husband, Don, died a day later. Wilkinson's husband, Ian, a 68-year-old minister, is in critical condition at a hospital. Patterson, who did not get sick from the meal, told reporters that she's devastated by what happened. I loved them. And I can't believe that this has happened and I'm so sorry, she said, per CNN. While Patterson has not publicly shared what she served her guests, experts say the symptoms they experienced are consistent with death cap mushroom poisoning. But what are death cap mushrooms and what symptoms would you experience if you ate them? Experts break it down. What are death cap mushrooms? Death cap mushrooms are a poisonous fungi, according to Britannica. They are the deadliest mushrooms, Jamie Alan, associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University, tells Yahoo Life. (While death cap mushrooms are considered the deadliest, other poisonous and potentially deadly fungi include Conocybe filaris, which is an innocent-looking lawn mushroom, webcap and destroying angel mushrooms.)

Capitol Hill lawmakers from both parties immediately pledged to go further in the coming months after President Biden announced his effort to prohibit Americans from investing in some Chinese companies.

Unlike the iOS ecosystem, where Apple is the only game in town, one of the best things about the Android phone market is the wide range of different devices and manufacturers to choose from. That said, when it actually comes time to upgrade, that wealth of options can make it a bit more difficult to choose the right handset for you. If you\u2019re looking for a new phone and don\u2019t know where to start, we\u2019ve got you covered with a selection of the best Android phones for every budget. What to look for in a new Android phone When it comes to picking our favorite Android phones, the main things we look for are pretty straightforward: good performance (both compute and AI), a nice display, solid design, sharp cameras, long battery life and a significant commitment to ongoing software support. For performance, not only do we look at benchmarks and other metrics, but we also evaluate phones based on responsiveness. Regardless of whether you\u2019re reading, scrolling through social media or playing a game, no one wants a device that feels sluggish. When it comes to displays, we generally prefer OLED panels that can produce rich, saturated colors with at least 600 nits of brightness, though many of our top mid-range and high-end phones can hit 1,000 nits or more. And more recently, most of our favorite devices also support screens with fast refresh rates of 90Hz or 120Hz, which adds an extra level of smoothness and fluidity. Now we will admit there is a bit of subjectivity when deciding which phones look the best, but there are other design aspects like dust and water resistance or screen durability that can make a big difference to long-term survival. It\u2019s also important to consider things like support for wireless charging, power sharing (aka reverse wireless charging) and UWB connectivity, which can have an impact on how your phone interacts with your other devices. Obviously, for photos we\u2019re looking for sharp, colorful shots in both bright and low-light conditions. And we want video clips with high dynamic range, rich audio and smooth image stabilization. Extra cameras for ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are a plus."}, {"This $12 grabber tool 'picks up tiny objects and heavy items with ease'": "You're in your kitchen chopping vegetables, when you notice a cherry tomato roll off the counter.

And it\u2019s a conference that figures to be extremely competitive in 2023. The Mountain West has had a different champion in each of the past four seasons. Could there be a fifth champion in five seasons? Fresno State, led by star quarterback Jake Haener, won the conference last year, besting Boise State in the title game. Boise State fans are accustomed to winning championships, but it\u2019s been since 2019 that the Broncos have earned the conference crown. In the two years between Boise\u2019s last title and Fresno State\u2019s 2022 triumph, there were two unexpected champions \u2014 San Jose State in 2020 and Utah State in 2021. Boise State and Fresno State are the two betting favorites entering the 2023 season, but there are a few teams who could potentially follow the paths of San Jose State and Utah State and become a surprise conference champion. Previously: AAC, C-USA, MAC Does Jake Haener\u2019s departure open the door for Boise State? How will Fresno State fare without Jake Haener at quarterback? Haener threw for more than 4,000 yards in 2021 and then lit up Mountain West defenses when he returned from an early-season injury last fall. The Bulldogs started 1-4 before finishing the season on a nine-game winning streak and winning the conference sparked by Haener\u2019s return to the lineup. Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today Entering 2023, the Bulldogs will turn to UCF transfer Mikey Keene or Logan Fife at quarterback, but they also have to replace top running back Jordan Mims and four of their top five receivers. FSU also lost a few top players on defense, including defensive end David Perales and safety Evan Williams. Will that open the door for Boise State? The Broncos are entering their third season under Andy Avalos and his tenure has been fairly tumultuous thus far. Boise finished 7-5 in 2021, its worst record since 1998, and then endured an ugly 2-2 start last year. Boise State\u2019s fortunes changed when Avalos made changes to the offense, including handing the reins of the offense to Taylen Green. Green was inconsistent as a passer, but his running ability added a much-needed dimension to the Broncos' attack. Green is back as the starter in 2023 with the running back duo of George Holani and Ashton Jeanty, though there is some turnover up front and top receiver Latrell Caples suffered a season-ending injury in preseason camp. There are some holes to fill on defense, too, but the Broncos may have the most talented roster in the conference. Another potential contender is Air Force. The Falcons have registered double-digit victories in the last three full seasons (they went 3-3 in 2020) and are extremely experienced on the offensive line and on defense. However, Air Force has to replace three-year starting QB Haaziq Daniels and workhorse running back Brad Roberts, who rushed for 1,728 yards and 17 TDs last fall. Can San Diego State bounce back after down season? San Diego State has been a consistent Mountain West contender over the past decade but is coming off a very underwhelming year. The Aztecs, who finished 7-6, had a brutal 2-3 start and had to move starting safety Jalen Mayden over to quarterback to try to spark a sputtering offense."}, {"Stocks climb as inflation ticks up but trends stay positive: Stock market news today": "Consumer prices rise in July, stalling inflation slowdown Stocks opened higher Thursday as newly released data showed inflation ticked up on an annual basis for the first time in over a year but disinflationary trends remained positive.

Nine years ago, Chai Baker awoke to a bewildering scene. The Oregon State basketball player had no idea why he was in a hospital bed, a tube down his throat, a monitor tracking his vital signs and loved ones by his side. It was terrifying,\u201d Baker said. I didn\u2019t know what happened. I didn\u2019t even know where I was or how long I\u2019d been there.\u201d Baker soon learned that he\u2019d collapsed two days earlier during a workout at Oregon State\u2019s practice facility. At first, teammates noticed him gasping for air in the layup line. Moments later, athletic trainer Tom Fregoso was scrambling to administer CPR and shock Baker\u2019s heart back into rhythm after the 19-year-old crumpled to the court and began convulsing. The cause of Baker\u2019s cardiac arrest turned out to be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a hereditary heart condition that Baker had never heard of before. He initially didn\u2019t grasp the severity when his physician told him that it causes the heart muscle to thicken and stiffen abnormally, impeding blood flow and increasing the risk of arrhythmias. By the time Baker returned to campus after a week in the hospital, he had made up his mind not to let his diagnosis stand in the way of his dreams. He felt fit and strong again. He had no chest pain or other symptoms. He was eager to implant a defibrillator in his chest so that he could return to playing basketball as quickly as possible. Baker says he would\u2019ve risked playing for Oregon State had the university not intervened and taken the decision away from him. Oregon State director of sports medicine Douglas Aukerman informed Baker in early November 2014 that the threat of another cardiac incident was too severe, that Baker could remain on scholarship but he couldn\u2019t play again for the Beavers. When they didn\u2019t clear me to play, it kind of crushed me,\u201d Baker said. It was very, very hard. I still felt physically like I could play. I didn\u2019t understand the severity of my situation and I didn\u2019t take it well.\u201d Baker\u2019s story hints at what may be ahead for Bronny James as he undergoes testing to determine the cause of his cardiac arrest on July 24 and evaluates whether to keep pursuing basketball. It isn\u2019t only up to LeBron James' eldest son and his family how much risk of a cardiac arrest recurrence they can tolerate. USC will also have to assess if the threat is too much to clear the highly touted incoming freshman to play for the Trojans. A USC spokesperson declined comment when Yahoo Sports asked for an explanation of how the university decides whether to clear an athlete with a newly diagnosed heart condition. Cardiologists who have been involved in these decisions say that universities typically evaluate anything from the athlete\u2019s risk of cardiac arrest, to the threat of a lawsuit or barrage of negative publicity if something went wrong. With college sports, there are lots of stakeholders that have an interest in the athlete playing but also not wanting to take on additional liability,\u201d said Lili A. Barouch, director of sports cardiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s not always a straightforward decision.\u201d The Hank Gathers impact It\u2019s easy to pinpoint when schools started becoming more cautious about the risk of allowing athletes to play through a heart condition. It was the day that a supremely talented prospect with so much life in front of him stumbled, collapsed and never got up again. Hank Gathers often declared himself to be the strongest man alive, but the Loyola Marymount forward wasn\u2019t as invincible as his muscular physique and charismatic personality suggested. He had a heart condition that caused him to faint during a December 1989 game against UC Santa Barbara and to suffer fatal cardiac arrest three months later after a soaring alley-oop dunk against Portland. The aftermath of the tragedy devolved into a deluge of malpractice and negligence allegations against the school, the doctors who treated Gathers and even his coach. Beverly Hills attorney Bruce Fagel filed a $32.5 million lawsuit on behalf of the Gathers family that ultimately netted a $545,000 settlement. Gathers\u2019 death lingered in the national headlines long after the LMU men\u2019s basketball team finished honoring its fallen star with an emotional Elite Eight run. Decades later, his story still casts a shadow over a struggling basketball program that has not won a conference title since 1990 nor returned to the NCAA tournament. That high-profile incident and another involving Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis inspired research into whether these deaths were anomalies."}, {"After multiple scandals, beauty influencer Jaclyn Hill announces she's shutting down some brands: 'I definitely feel ashamed and like I blew it'": "Just weeks after landing herself in yet another social media scandal, beauty influencer Jaclyn Hill issued a surprising announcement on YouTube: She\u2019s shutting down several of her brands.

Along the way, she launched multiple beauty and lifestyle-related brands; but her rise to fame didn\u2019t come without some drama. Hill has been mired in multiple controversies over the years \u2014 including her most infamous one in 2019 when customers claimed that a lipstick from her newly launched makeup brand, Jaclyn Cosmetics, arrived broken, lumpy and even dirty. At the time, Hill apologized to anyone dissatisfied with the product but insisted there was nothing wrong with her lipsticks. My lipsticks are not moldy. They are not hazardous. They are not contaminated. They are not unsafe for you in any way, shape or form,\u201d said Hill. Every single ingredient in my lipstick is new and is FDA-approved.\u201d Still, not everyone was happy with how she handled things.

Lizzo is continuing to make headlines one week after being sued by three former dancers for sexual harassment, facilitating a hostile work environment and other troubling claims. The Grammy winner has denied all wrongdoing. As the controversy unfolds, there are more questions than answers. Have more dancers come forward?

We have received at least six inquiries from other people with similar stories since we filed the complaint, Ron Zambrano, partner and employment litigation chair at West Coast Employment Lawyers, told Yahoo Entertainment on Wednesday. Noelle, Crystal and Arianna have bravely spoken out and shared their experiences, opening the door for others to feel empowered to do the same.

This series will shine a light on the most unusual NHL players \u2014 the guys who stand out from their peers in one way or another. Part 3 looks at the most and least physical players in the league. Previous articles: Size and Nationality \u2014 There is an absolutely massive range in physicality among NHL players as some make their living by throwing their body around and others see hard contact as an obstacle rather than a goal. Although the game has become more and more dominated by skill in recent years, there are still plenty of guys who earn their salaries by making life painful and difficult for opponents, while leaving the scoring to others. The players highlighted below either embrace the physical aspect of the sport more than any of their peers, or opt to rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 engage with it. The most prolific hitter: Michael Pezzetta, LW, Montreal Canadiens Laying out opponents is Pezzetta's calling card, as he offers limited offensive value and has an average ice time of 8:39 in his brief NHL career. Over the last two seasons, the 25-year-old has delivered 24.01 hits per 60 minutes \u2014 significantly more than the man who ranks second by that metric (Ryan Reaves at 20.13). The winger has never had much of a role beyond tone-setting in his professional career. He's produced 26 points in 114 NHL games and 25 points in 115 AHL games. Even in the OHL, he managed just 0.46 points per game. Listed at 6-foot-1, 210 pounds, Pezzetta isn't a massive wrecking ball of a human being, but he has a knack for making his presence felt.

The least prolific hitter: Johnny Gaudreau, LW, Columbus Blue Jackets  It makes sense that a 5-foot-9 offensive winger listed at 165 pounds wouldn't be among the NHL's top hitters, but Gaudreau's total avoidance of hitting sets him apart.

Our team recently conducted a 10-team, dynasty startup fantasy football mock (with half-point-per-reception scoring), and all the picks are in the cool graphic up top. Scroll to the right of the graphic above to see the complete results of the draft. For those unfamiliar with dynasty formats, it's a league where you retain your roster season-to-season compared to a redraft league where rosters reset every year. A dynasty league is also different from a keeper league, where you're limited in the number of players you can retain. Our partners at 4for4 have a more in-depth look at dynasty leagues. More mock drafts: 10-team half-PPR | 12-team full-PPR] Don\u2019t be a massive ageist. Please. I\u2019m begging you to not be solely youth-focused when you head into these exercises. This particularly applies to the early rounds. Take, for example, a guy like Davante Adams in this exercise. He went in the bottom of Round 3 behind multiple wide receivers who, while I like their games quite a bit, don\u2019t have a prayer of being as good as Adams over the next two seasons \u2014 or ever, for that matter. You could argue even I\u2019m guilty of this type of ageism by taking Brandon Aiyuk one pick ahead of Cooper Kupp in Round 4. I know there are some dynasty folks who will read this and laugh at the idea of the next two years,\u201d as if that\u2019s all that matters. I\u2019ll just say that windows are never as long as you think and the exercise of a dynasty rebuild is no lock to work out. Look, building dynasty rosters is a matter of personal preference \u2014 subjective player evaluation comes into the mix along with differing goal-based timelines and varying opinions about positional value. So, honestly, maybe don\u2019t even take anything I\u2019m writing in this recap seriously. It\u2019s your team. Who cares what anyone has to say? Me included. [Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today] Personally, I\u2019m not trying to play dynasty fantasy football like it\u2019s some pseudo-stock market or pretending internet player values\u201d or rankings mean anything at all to individual league managers. I am just both trying to win the league every season and keep players on my team whom I think are good at football. That requires a balanced roster of promising youth and high-caliber players who may perhaps be rounding toward the back nine of their careers. As for you and your house, do as you please. Running backs crash the party I\u2019ve been in some dynasty drafts where wide receiver is placed at a tremendous premium. That was not necessarily the case in this draft. Five running backs went in the first eight picks. Bijan Robinson landing third overall isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. He\u2019s an excellent prospect entering the league, already a clear Round 1 fantasy selection in redraft. So this sort of dynasty value makes sense. Even a guy like Christian McCaffrey, while a mild surprise as high as fourth overall, is such a rare producer that I can understand taking the plunge in Round 1. The other backs took me by surprise just a bit simply because we know the longevity concerns at the position. Round 2, on the other hand, saw just three RB selections as drafters turned their eyes to receivers. Ironically, all three drafters that took running backs at Pick 6, 7 and 8 in Round 1 ended up with a wide receiver I\u2019d straight-up rather roster in dynasty. So I guess that worked out. The most interesting back in Round 2 is Breece Hall right at the top. I understand he\u2019s currently dealing with an injury but I\u2019d guess that if Hall has an awesome stretch run or back half of 2023, he\u2019ll be a first-round startup selection in 2024 given his age and explosive ability. If you don\u2019t break the QB dam early, just wait Speaking as one of the folks who helped break the quarterback dam in Round 3, I\u2019m perfectly happy with making the major swing for Josh Allen even in a 1QB league. I won\u2019t think about that position again for many years other than churning the QB2 spot, which I didn't even bother to address in this draft considering some of the names on the waiver wire. In total, three quarterbacks \u2014 Allen, Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes \u2014 went off the board in Round 3 with Joe Burrow not far behind in Round 4. Four more quarterbacks went off the board in Rounds 5 and 6. While I like some of those swings, especially Anthony Richardson in Round 6, I do worry some of these quarterbacks aren\u2019t going to be enough of individual difference-makers over the long-term in a start-one quarterback format. They\u2019ll have their moments, certainly, but remember we need to start three wide receivers and a flex in this league. Value over replacement and opportunity cost matter just as much in a dynasty startup as they do in your seasonal leagues. I ended up liking the approach of a drafter like Dan Titus who waited until the double-digit rounds and took multiple bites of the apple with upside swings mixed in. That\u2019s a viable strategy in this format. Wide receiver is just so deep We get to rounds 8, 9 and 10 and it\u2019s tough for me to find a receiver pick I do not like. You can get veterans with strong near-term windows in this range like Mike Williams, Christian Kirk and Tyler Lockett. You can take big swings on talented second- and third-year guys like George Pickens, Rashod Bateman and Elijah Moore who all have a shot to rocket up startup boards next year with a few breaks in 2023. You can also just make your Tier 3 rookie bets in this range like Jalin Hyatt, Rashee Rice and Jonathan Mingo (my favorite pick here). Definitely stack your team early with high-caliber WR1 candidates. But don\u2019t forget to start rounding out at receiver as it gets later. Some second- and third-year running backs went late If you\u2019re going receiver early and taking the plunge on an elite quarterback in a startup you\u2019re sacrificing at running back. That was my approach. The good news is that there are multiple Year 2 and 3 running backs who could hold down the top spot on their team\u2019s depth chart for a few seasons, at least. We know this position is hyper fragile and even highly drafted or very good players can be usurped at any moment. That applies to the guys like Rhamondre Stevenson, Dameon Pierce, Travis Etienne and Najee Harris. But again, if we\u2019re just thinking in those near-term windows, those guys can help keep your team strong for now as your wide receiver corps does the heavy lifting. You just have to plan to do some tinkering on an annual basis with your backfield. The dynasty TE landscape is even weirder than redraft Just one tight end came off the board in Round 3 and of course, it was Travis Kelce. The Chiefs tight end will turn 34 this season but the position is in such a state of flux, even the most youth-focused, fake stock-broker dynasty player couldn\u2019t form a credible argument to hate that pick. We then saw three tight ends get picked in Rounds 4 and 5, and then another three between Rounds 7 and 9. Moral of the story: we don\u2019t even know what to do with this position long-term. Never once did it ever feel like this draft was about to experience a tight end run as we witnessed at other positions. The tier breaks at tight end are difficult to project and the gap between said tiers is massive. [Overall Top 300 | QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | DEFs | Ks Jahan Dotson is likely the most underrated dynasty WR Jahan Dotson is a very good football player. He was a completely underrated prospect who even outkicked my lofty expectations with his ability to beat press coverage as a pure outside receiver. It wasn\u2019t that Dotson went super late here. He came off the board in Round 6 (shockingly, to my team). When looking at the 2022 drafted receivers, Dotson is much closer to Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson and Drake London as a talent than he is to Christian Watson, Treylon Burks and George Pickens. Dotson is a crisp and refined route runner \u2014 but that\u2019s not all he is; people who think that are just profiling him based on size. Dotson showed in Year 1 he\u2019s just as capable of making explosive plays in the vertical passing game and winning contested passes as some of these bigger receivers folks like more. Too many people who play fantasy football are still wide receiver size-ists. Take advantage of them. The QB situation still isn\u2019t clean and he\u2019s paired with a true alpha, top-10 real-life receiver in Terry McLaurin but everything about Dotson as an individual player is screaming upward trajectory. I think too many dynasty players didn\u2019t really watch him as a rookie and are still holding onto pre-draft priors. Here are the team-by-team results of the mock draft in order of selection.

Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today We actually used to produce an annual feature on third-year breakout receivers, because no sensible person expected fantasy relevance from an unseasoned, inexperienced wideout.

Odell Beckham Jr. was an instant superstar, a target magnet, almost cartoonishly gifted.

QB Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars \u2014 Yahoo Projection: 331.66 points Trevor Lawrence kicked off his professional career in 2021 to much fanfare and as hyped as you could imagine after wrapping up his college days early. He wasn't even a remotely great fantasy player in his rookie season (he nearly missed the top-25 QB list that year) but last season was an entirely different story for the then-sophomore Jaguar. Entering 2023, Yahoo projects T-Law to throw passes for a few hundred more yards than he did last year, to break the 30+ touchdown barrier, and to finish with 330+ fantasy points for an average of around 19+ FP per game next season. Sorry, but I just can't see such a jump happening this early in his career. Lawrence will play his age-24 season in 2023. He should be years away from reaching his absolute prime. Even then, he's already put up gaudy numbers so there might not be much room to grow in Jacksonville for him. The sophomore QB threw the seventh-most passes last year (nearly 600 already), accrued the ninth-most passing yards and boosted his fantasy value with the fifth-best and 10th-best marks on rushing touchdowns (five) and yards (291). We were told Lawrence was going to be a generational player, so hey, perhaps he can put up Yahoo's projections. That said, the platform is expecting Lawrence to do something only the other 11 quarterbacks have done before him (baseline of 4,400+ passing yards, 30+ TDs, and 25+ rushing yards). In the last five years only Joe Burrow, Josh Allen, Justin Herbert and Patrick Mahomes reached those benchmarks in their third pro-seasons or earlier. However, Lawrence will need to reach those numbers with Calvin Ridley as his WR1, who's coming off spending more than a year on the shelf. Not trusting this projection just one bit. QB Russell Wilson, Denver Broncos \u2014 Yahoo Projection: 301.42 points The Denver Broncos started a new era last season when they decided to trade their house away for the right of calling Russell Wilson one of their own. Denver decided to make another bold move this summer, the second in as many years, by hiring former Super Bowl champion HC, Sean Payton. Will the Broncos' offense suffer a sudden improvement and rise as a whole on their way to fixing their 2022 wrongs? Allow me to think that won't happen \u2014 at least, not to the extent Yahoo is projecting it. Wilson is coming off the worst season he's ever played in the NFL. He posted his worst marks on total fantasy points, FP per game and FP per snap. Wilson threw his fewest touchdowns ever (16), the second-most interceptions through his career (11) and completed a measly 60.5% of his 292 pass attempts, another career-low. The Broncos' offense, barren of truly talented weapons, didn't help. It won't help this year, either, as Denver has already lost WRs Tim Patrick and KJ Hamler for the season and will need to ease RB1 Javonte Williams in as he's coming off an ACL injury. While the change of head coach might turn into a volume boost on the passing front, I'm not buying the overall improvement of this offense and therefore I think Wilson will fail to deliver for the second season in a row."}, {"Frozen cereal hack goes viral on TikTok, and cereal lovers\u2019 minds are blown: \u2018You\u2019ve just changed my life\u2019": "Breakfast lovers are wondering how they ever ate cereal without this latest TikTok hack, which is being hailed as life-changing.

Our team recently conducted a 12-team, full-point-per-reception fantasy football mock, and all the picks are in the cool graphic up top. Scroll to the right of the graphic above to see the complete results of the draft. Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today Team-by-team results are at the bottom of the article \u2014 but first, some interesting findings about the draft's results from our very own Dalton Del Don. Check out our 10-team half-PPR mock draft here. Injuries and holdouts made an impact \u2022 Jonathan Taylor\u2019s ADP has been dropping given his uncertain situation, but he suffered no dip in this mock. Aside from his contract situation (and assuming his back is fine as he says), Taylor has questions regarding targets and raw rookie Anthony Richardson taking over at QB. But he\u2019s also one season removed from totaling 2,200+ yards with 20 touchdowns and could be legitimately the best back in football. Richardson should also open the field for Taylor, so it\u2019s hard to argue with the pick. That said, given that mobile quarterbacks typically don\u2019t throw as much to their running backs, Taylor can be downgraded a bit in PPR formats. \u2022 Breece Hall fell nearly a full round past his Yahoo ADP, likely due to the Dalvin Cook-to-the-Jets rumors swirling during this draft (Hall\u2019s fantasy value should be boosted in PPR). Cook left New York without a deal, and his eventual landing spot remains a mystery. Cook could be better this season after finally undergoing shoulder surgery, but he\u2019d need to improve dramatically to keep a healthy Hall off the field. Hall\u2019s fantasy managers may require a little patience either way, but he\u2019s likely to be a top-five fantasy player over the second half and is my favorite to be the consensus No. 1 overall pick in 2024. \u2022 I rank Ja\u2019Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson incredibly close but still went Chase despite Joe Burrow\u2019s injury scare. Given how much time there is before the season, I\u2019m treating Burrow\u2019s calf injury as if he\u2019ll be good to go Week 1 (as long as he doesn't listen to Chase's advice). I give Chase the ever so slight edge given his touchdown advantage \u2014 Chase has just three fewer TD catches in 21 fewer games than JJ and played injured last season \u2014 and being tied to Burrow, but most drafters disagree. WR is a huge priority in PPR \u2022 As expected in a PPR format, this draft resulted in more wide receivers (18 of the first 34 picks) being drafted early compared to our previous 0.5 PPR mock (14 of the first 35 picks were WRs). While the aggressive drafting left few sleeper receivers available later, Rashee Rice was an exception (says the person who drafted him). Quarterbacks, on the other hand, aren't \u2022 Quarterbacks dropped in this draft compared to the previous 10-teamer, which makes sense given the format differences. Wide receiver becomes a bigger priority in a 12-team PPR league. Jalen Hurts and Josh Allen were both steals in round three, while Lamar Jackson and Justin Fields were also strong picks in round four (the QB tier then suffers a big drop thanks to the rushing-upside discrepancy). That said, it\u2019s also perfectly fine to wait until much later to address quarterback in leagues that start just one, highlighted in this draft by Tua Tagovailoa going at the end of round nine. Tagovailoa got 8.9 (!) YPA last season, when he threw as many touchdowns as Tom Brady in 333 fewer attempts. \u2022 I have Daniel Jones as a top-10 fantasy QB this year (with top-five potential), but he was an afterthought in this draft. Brock Purdy is in the world\u2019s best system and led all QBs in fantasy points per dropback last season \u2014 and wasn\u2019t even drafted here. There are multiple strategies to attack QB in 2023 (and they can vary greatly depending on format), so waiting on the position certainly remains viable. Some undervalued picks to highlight \u2022 Drake London has a top-36 ADP on other PPR sites, so he looks like a steal at pick No. 57 here. London had a historically good rookie season, will no longer have Marcus Mariota throwing to him and has the weakest WR2 competition in the league. London is the real deal, and Atlanta is likely to pass more in 2023. Questions remain regarding Desmond Ridder, but London gets to play indoors for a Falcons team that projects to have an incredibly favorable schedule. The Drake is good! \u2022 Courtland Sutton already looked like a good value in the 10th round of a PPR draft, but he looks like a great one now that Tim Patrick and KJ Hamler are out indefinitely (the Patrick injury news had just barely broken when we drafted). Sutton was a fantasy bust in 2022, but don\u2019t forget he was being drafted ahead of Jerry Jeudy at this time last year, and Denver\u2019s offense was a dysfunctional mess. With targets now opening (Jeudy has had trouble staying healthy as well), and Javonte Williams unlikely to be himself (he\u2019ll be wearing a knee brace) right away, Sutton is suddenly looking at a real opportunity. He\u2019s still just 27 and is another year removed from his knee surgery. The Sean Payton factor shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, as the Broncos are about to undergo a dramatic upgrade in coaching not unlike what Jacksonville experienced last season. Russell Wilson has worked hard during the offseason after last year\u2019s disastrous performance (and Jarrett Stidham is a more than capable alternative if Payton prefers him). Sutton was extremely undervalued being selected as the WR48 in this draft. Here are the team-by-team results of the mock draft in order of selection.

Selecting one early in the draft is one of the most significant moves a franchise can make. It marks a starting point of a new era, and puts a face to its vision of the future. The front office, coaching staff, players and fans are all ready to turn the page on the previous challenging season and embrace a new direction. In today\u2019s NFL, they usually don\u2019t have to wait very long to see their quarterback in action. There will always be exceptions like Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers or Jordan Love. But for the vast majority of these guys, the luxury of learning on the sidelines is not an option. That appears to be the case with this year\u2019s class. Bryce Young, C.J. Stroud and Anthony Richardson each could realistically be under center when the season opens. Wagering on win totals isn\u2019t always just about combing over the schedule, grading offseason moves and applying your projections. It can be beneficial to target situations that surface year after year, and see if the historical data can provide a small edge. That can be new head coaches, quarterbacks with new playcallers or rookies playing against NFL defenses for the first time. Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today Clevanalytics had some interesting data on the success of teams that relied on first-round quarterbacks (for at least nine starts) in their rookie season. Since 2014, only 36% of teams went over their preseason win total. Going back to 2002, only 26.8% have won more than 50% of the games they started in Year 1. These are both based on small sample sizes, and the results are a combination of the massive jump from college and the lofty expectations from bettors for these players. How will this season\u2019s rookie quarterbacks fare?"}, {"2023 Fantasy Football Draft Day Blueprint: The guide you need to succeed": "Last season on Yahoo, 87.1% of teams that started 5-0 made their fantasy playoffs. Among 4-1 starters, 71.8% of teams made the dance. Once you got to 3-2, it could go either way; 50% of teams made the playoffs. Anything below .500 and the odds were stacked against you. Fantasy football season is nearly upon us. In a matter of weeks, millions of people will draft their teams and begin the pursuit of fantasy glory. But if we\u2019re being real, millions of folks have already done just that. For me, football is my year-round obsession. Not a day goes by that I don\u2019t consider the sport and the potential range of outcomes for the upcoming season. I think about this 365 days so you don\u2019t have to.

Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today Big picture thoughts for the 2023 season The more I have thought about fantasy football this year, the more I\u2019m convinced it all starts at quarterback. How you approach the quarterback decides the rest of your team. No pressure. I was all-in on going early quarterback this year. I\u2019ve said it many times on the Yahoo Fantasy Football Show: all my good teams last season featured either Jalen Hurts or Josh Allen. I am a full believer that elite QBs are back in the mix for early draft consideration because players like that are both incredibly efficient passers and offer rushing upside to break that game. The ceiling and floor combination is tough to beat. But pieces like Andy Behrens\u2019 Is waiting at QB still a winning strategy?\u201d and conversations like the one I had on the podcast recently with Dalton Del Don have me wavering. There are some very appealing quarterbacks who go late in drafts. And same as it ever was, the opportunity cost of taking an early quarterback remains. I want to make sure I have at least one anchor running back who comes from the first two rounds of drafts. I want a strong three-wide receiver corps that is filled with alpha target hogs or clear 1B receivers on a great offense. I loved the way Scott Pianowski said it on a recent podcast: Get three receivers who start themselves.\u201d All of that is hard to pull off if you also want to lock in someone from the first tier of quarterbacks. Do I pass on that elite tier and try to hunt for rushing-based breakout candidates like Anthony Richardson or Daniel Jones? When you hit on one of those guys and they actually emerge as a fringe top-five scorer and your early running back and receiver picks work out, you build an unfair roster. And yet, Andy\u2019s words from his quarterback piece stick with me: In recent years, however, we've witnessed a string of the most remarkable individual quarterback campaigns in league history; golden-ticket seasons for fantasy purposes. Patrick Mahomes set the all-time QB fantasy scoring record in 2018. Lamar Jackson set the per-game scoring record the following year. Mahomes, Jalen Hurts and Josh Allen each produced seasons in 2022 that rank among the top-12 historically on a per-game basis. Mahomes now has the No. 1 and No. 2 QB scoring campaigns on his resume. Twelve of the top 18 all-time fantasy seasons at this position were delivered over the past five years.\u201d Those seasons were legendary and that\u2019s why all of those players \u2014 yes, including Jackson \u2014 make up my first tier. I am fully convinced all of those players can have seasons like that again in 2023. And I don\u2019t mind paying for the certainty. I haven\u2019t fully decided just which side of this internal debate I\u2019ll land on being best for the season. Frankly, since I believe both are viable, it gives me the flexibility to live in the moment and let each individual draft come to me. I\u2019d advise you to do the same. Best fantasy ecosystems (drink) If you know me, I am all about ecosystems. Fantasy football can be all about hammering players from the best ecosystems in the NFL. I always think back to the Peyton Manning Broncos teams circa 2013. Sometimes winning your fantasy league is as simple as hoarding as many players from those kinds of special offenses. It\u2019s obvious that great ecosystems equate to some of the most potent and efficient offenses in the NFL. They\u2019re surrounded by a quality line, loaded with good skill position talent and stewarded by a high-end play-caller. But there\u2019s more to it than that. In fantasy, it\u2019s important we look at these highly concentrated offenses around the league. The 2022 Eagles were the best example of this. They had three star-caliber skill-position players and that\u2019s where they threw the ball. If they were dropping back to pass, the ball was going to A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith or Dallas Goedert. Those guys combined for over 80% of the team targets. They didn\u2019t mess around with a pass-catching back, a third receiver or a red-zone menace tight end. If they kept it on the ground, they were breaking the math and hammering people in the run game with Miles Sanders or Jalen Hurts. It made them painfully hard to defend but quite easy to predict in fantasy. The Jacksonville Jaguars could be this year\u2019s Eagles; an efficient offense with a concentrated target tree. You can confidently draft Calvin Ridley, Christian Kirk and Evan Engram because they\u2019ll be drawing the vast majority of looks. The 49ers have a setup like that with their top four guys and the Seahawks' receiver set should handle the bulk of the targets. You can be in on all three of DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and Jaxson Smith-Njigba in fantasy this season. I am, because Geno Smith\u2019s performance was legitimate in every sense of the word. Those are my four favorite ecosystems to target in 2023. Every year, I write about the teams we need to get right in fantasy football. The 2023 edition included the Browns, Chargers and Colts. With a few breaks, any or all of those three teams could jump into the elite ecosystem tier. You can call them the cautiously optimistic honorable mentions. Fast Start vs. Hot Finish Whether analysts know it or want to admit it, best-ball brain has seeped into all of our content. The popularity and fun of Best Ball (available on Yahoo) have made it hard to transition the way we talk about that game into traditional redraft leagues. There is a difference, though. With many looking to take down massive best-ball contests, we\u2019ve gotten overly obsessed with the end of the season. You\u2019ll hear folks say Weeks 15, 16, 17 \u2026 the ones that matter most for fantasy football,\u201d when analyzing individual player or team outlooks. That\u2019s true in a sense, even for redraft-managed teams. Those are the fantasy playoffs and we all want to win those weeks to take the league championship. We know why they\u2019re a focus but, you have to get there in the first place for them to matter at all. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m changing my tune a bit. I have always been fine with drafting my teams with a flippant attitude to the start of the season to leave myself open to late-season upside. I\u2019m usually all about the hot finish. No one has caused me to reevaluate that stance more than Scott Pianowski. He's banged the drum about the benefits of starting fast for years and has pushed fantasy managers to draft to win September.\u201d The numbers are on his side. Life is just a lot easier if you\u2019re riding hot coming into mid-October. You can start filling your bench with late-season upside stashes like your favorite rookie receiver or a high-end backup running back when you don\u2019t have to worry about chasing needs on waivers. You can get the best of both worlds with that hot start."}, {"Trio scammed Target stores using \u2018sleight of hand\u2019 trick to buy gift cards, feds say": "Coast Guard reports rescuing more than 50 people who jumped into water to escape deadly Hawaii wildfire Three Romanian citizens accused of defrauding Target stores across the U.S. have been sentenced to prison, authorities said.

But while car prices drop, insurance rates are rising for weary consumers New and used car prices are continuing to drop, according to the latest government inflation data released Wednesday morning. The bottom line? Consumers may be buying more cars. For the month of July, consumer prices for new autos were down 0.1% compared to June and up 3.5% year over year, with the yearly figure coming down considerably compared to the prior month\u2019s 4.1%. The used car market saw even more moderation, with prices down 1.3% for the month of July alone, and dropping 5.6% year over year. Car prices, in particular for used vehicles, seem to be coming down faster compared to inflation in the broader economy, which saw overall CPI rise 3.2% in July year over year. That was below analyst expectations of 3.3%, but more than the June\u2019s 3%.

Here's what to know about prices for beef, chicken, eggs, fruit, and sweets. Grocery prices had been cooling, then came July. The cost of food at home \u2014 what consumers see at their local supermarkets such as Kroger (KR), Albertsons (ACI), and others \u2014 increased slightly in July after remaining mostly flat in recent months. Grocery prices increased by 0.3% on a monthly basis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) released Thursday. On a year-over-year basis, food-at-home inflation rose 3.6%, a slower rate than the month prior. Overall, consumer prices were up by 3.2% in July over the prior year and 0.2% month over month. The beef and veal category, which rose 2.4%, was one of the biggest drivers of the month-over-month increase. The category saw the largest jump since September 2021, BLS economist Steve Reed told Yahoo Finance. Uncooked beef roasts led that monthly jump with a 6.5% increase from June to July. Beef steaks were up 2.3%, while other cuts of beef and veal were up 3.6%. What's behind the jump? According to Wells Fargo agricultural economist Michael Swanson, higher beef prices stem from the aftermath of one of the worst droughts we've had in the Southwest last year and a sell-off of all the cattle. Essentially when a drought happens, producers sell off cows at once, which makes beef cheap. Now, as ranchers rebuild their herds, higher feed prices are costing them more and driving up prices overall."}, {"The best hair growth products of 2023": "Hair loss impacts millions of people in the U.S., and not just aesthetically; it's linked to a greater risk of developing stress and depression. To add insult to injury, hair loss is complicated, and the right solution requires understanding the underlying cause of the thinning and loss. The most common cause of hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, aka male pattern hair loss or female pattern hair loss, explains Dr. Amy Forman Taub, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant professor at Northwestern University Medical School. The second most common is called telogen effluvium and can be caused by many things, including severe stress, childbirth, certain drugs and thyroid abnormalities, Taub says. Thankfully, in most cases, hair thinning and loss can be treated and reversed with great success. Given that millions suffer from hair thinning and hair loss, the market is beyond saturated with lotions and potions promising miracles. Choosing the wrong product means wasting money, as well as time that could be spent on the right solution for you. To help you better understand what's going on with your distressed tresses, we consulted with multiple dermatologists and hair loss specialists for their input on what works and what doesn't, and what to specifically look for in hair growth products to give you the best chance of success. We also made sure to include a range of products at various price points to help meet you where you're at, so you can get started on the road to recovery as soon as possible. Before we dive into the best hair regrowth treatments, there are a few factors to consider before shopping for the best hair growth product for you. Key considerations The best hair growth product for you ultimately depends on what's causing your hair loss, Dr. Michelle Henry, a board-certified dermatologist and Harvard-trained Mohs surgeon who specializes in hair loss, tells Yahoo Life. For cases related to genetic hair loss, two commonly prescribed and FDA-approved treatments are minoxidil and finasteride, she says. These treatments have demonstrated positive results in stimulating hair regrowth, although individual responses may vary. If your hair loss is extreme or you're concerned about the cause, consulting a board-certified dermatologist is recommended. One common cause of temporary hair loss and thinning is illness, including COVID-19, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). While there isn't a specific immediate cure for COVID-induced hair loss, there are several steps you can take to promote regrowth and improve the overall health of your hair post-illness, Dr. Jake Woods, a board-certified dermatologist at Gya Labs, tells Yahoo Life. If you notice hair loss three to four months after a mild to severe bout of Covid or the flu, you can almost bet that is the cause. People can also develop hair loss from underlying medical conditions like alopecia areata, Taub says. And, of course, there's the genetic role our DNA plays in hair loss. The good news is that regardless of the source of your thinning and balding, there is a treatment to help reverse or reduce the shedding. There are a range of products on the market that can help with hair loss and thinning. These include: Serums Shampoos Oils Foams Prescription medications Vitamins and supplements Hair growth products can be costly, so it's important to figure out in advance how much you can comfortably spend. Keep in mind that spending more won't necessarily get you better results. Instead, focus on finding the right treatment plan for your particular type of hair loss, as well as your individual needs. Type: Topical solution Key ingredient: 5% minoxidil Best for: Pattern baldness, all-over regrowth It's been a leader in hair growth products for over 30 years, so it's no surprise that Rogaine tops our list.

It's also easy to apply and can be used in the shower. As with many hair growth products, the best results with Rogaine come the earlier you address hair shedding. While this particular 5% solution treatment is recommended for men, there is also Rogaine for women with a specially formulated 2% solution. On month two, I could already see results, and month three I am clear that this product works for me, says a happy customer. Type: Spray Key ingredient: 5% minoxidil Best for: Thinning hair Tomum's 5% minoxidil hair growth treatment features the same key ingredient as many popular hair regrowth products at a fraction of the cost. This treatment comes in the form of a spray, so you can target the areas where you need it most.

But beneath the surface of the 3.2% headline number revealed in Thursday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report are several signs the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation is headed in the right direction. The July CPI report offered more convincing evidence that inflation pressures are abating, EY-Parthenon senior economist Lydia Boussour said on Thursday. Fuel price increases helped force headline inflation back up in July. When looking at core inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge that strips out the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose at their slowest pace since October 2021. Core prices increased 4.7% year-over-year in July, down from 4.8% in June and 5.9% in July 2022. On a monthly basis, core CPI increased 0.2% for the second-straight month, marking the first time since February 2021 that core CPI rose just 0.2% in consecutive months."}, {"Lil Tay not actually dead: Child rapper and her brother are 'safe and alive' after apparent death hoax": "It turns out that Lil Tay, the Canadian internet child rapper, is not actually dead. One day after it was announced on her official Instagram account that she and her brother, 21-year-old Jason Tian, had both died, the provocative performer and social media influencer who found internet fame at age 9 with her foul-mouthed antics and cash flashing before abruptly dropping off social media in 2018, has surfaced to say it was a hoax and that her account was hacked. I want to make it clear that my brother and I are safe and alive, but I\u2019m completely heartbroken and struggling to even find the right words to say, Tay told TMZ on Thursday. It\u2019s been a very traumatizing 24 hours. All day yesterday, I was bombarded with endless heartbreaking and tearful phone calls from loved ones all while trying to sort out this mess. She said her Instagram account was compromised by a 3rd party and it was used to spread jarring misinformation and rumors regarding me, to the point that even my name was wrong. My legal name is Tay Tian, not 'Claire Hope.' She thanked Meta, owner of Instagram, for helping her get back into her account. What happened? The good news comes amid a very strange 24 hours. On Wednesday, the announcement that Tay and her brother, an aspiring rapper, had died appeared on her account, which has 3.3 million followers."}, {"Social Security's cost-of-living increase could be only 3%: Will that be enough?": "Fed's Daly tells Yahoo Finance there's 'still more work to do' on inflation Seniors brace yourselves. You will likely be getting a 3% Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, next year, well below the 8.7% increase in benefits received this year. That's the new 2024 estimate from The Senior Citizens League (SCL), which translates to an average monthly benefit check hike of less than $54. You can thank cooling inflation for the potentially paltry COLA. This year\u2019s leap, the biggest increase in four decades, raised the average retiree benefit by more than $140 per month. The smaller COLA would sting the more than 70 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who are still grappling with the lingering squeeze from high prices, such as those seen in housing and health care, according to the nonpartisan group. Older consumers, especially those with lower retirement incomes remain vulnerable to some of the higher prices that haven\u2019t gone down, Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League, told Yahoo Finance. The crystal ball COLA estimate is based on inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning that showed consumer prices in July rose 3.2% over the prior year, a slight bump from June's 3% annual increase but far below last year\u2019s soaring inflation. The actual COLA, which the Social Security Administration is expected to announce in mid-October, is calculated by averaging together the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for the third quarter of the year \u2014 July, August, and September of 2023 \u2014 and then comparing that figure with the same data from last year."}, {"San Francisco Fed\u2019s Daly: 'There\u2019s still more work to do' on inflation": "San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said a new report out Thursday showed inflation is coming down but is still too high, leaving the central bank with more work to do. The CPI data came in largely as expected and that is good news, Daly told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview, referring to a 3.2% rise in the Consumer Price Index in July over the prior year, a slight acceleration from June's 3% annual increase but in line with forecasts. It's also consistent with what we believe will be happening, which is that inflation will gradually make its way down, she added. But it is not a data point that says victory is ours. There's still more work to do.\u201d When looking at core inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge that strips out the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose at their slowest pace since October 2021. Core prices increased 4.7% year over year in July, down from 4.8% in June and 5.9% in July 2022. While trending in the right direction, inflation remains well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Daly said she is highly data dependent and is reserving her judgment for how much work is needed to bring down inflation until the Fed\u2019s September policy meeting, when she will pencil in her projections for interest rates."}, {"Dow inches up as inflation trends stay positive: Stock market news today": "Fed's Daly tells Yahoo Finance there's 'still more work to do' on inflation Stocks inched higher Thursday as newly released data showed inflation ticked up on an annual basis for the first time in over a year but disinflationary trends remained positive.
